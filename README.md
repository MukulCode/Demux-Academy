## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) installed. I strongly recommend you to update all the libraries and sync the project(might take a minute).



## Running the application
This is a prototype and does not require any kind of key, so feel free to hit the green run icon after a successful build.

## Troubleshooting your local environment

Always `git pull` and get the latest from master. [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your friends. You can find answers for most technical problems there. If you run into problems you can't resolve, feel free to open an issue.

## Best practices

1. Try to do a root cause analysis for the issue, if applicable.
2. Reference the issue being fixed in the corresponding PR.
3. Use meaningful commit messages in a PR.
4. Use one commit per task. Do not over commit (add unnecessary commits for a single task) or under commit (merge 2 or more tasks in one commit).
5. Add screenshot/short video in case the changes made in the PR, are being reflected in the UI of the application.
6. Close the issue as soon as the corresponding PR is accepted/closed.
  

## Some don'ts

1. Send a MR without an existing issue.
2. Fix an issue assigned to somebody else and submit a PR before the assignee does.
3. Report issues which are previously reported by others. (Please check both the open and closed issues).
4. Suggest unnecessary or completely new features in the issue list.
5. Add unnecessary spacing or indentation to the code.
